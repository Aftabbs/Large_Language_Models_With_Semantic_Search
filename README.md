## Introduction
   
This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for implementing semantic search, a powerful approach that enhances traditional keyword-based search by understanding the meaning and context behind queries. Unlike conventional methods, semantic search enables models to find relevant results by interpreting the intent and meaning of the input, producing more accurate and contextually aligned responses. By leveraging LLMs, embeddings, and various retrieval techniques, this project demonstrates how to perform high-quality semantic search and generate relevant answers efficiently.
     
## Traditional Search vs. Semantic Search

### Traditional Approach
In traditional search, keyword-based methods are typically employed to match user queries with text documents. Search engines use exact keyword matching or slightly enhanced term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) methods. However, this approach has limitations:
- **Literal Matching**: Traditional search methods look for exact keyword matches, often missing relevant results that use synonyms or similar concepts.
- **Lack of Context**: These methods are unable to understand context, which can lead to irrelevant results if the userâ€™s intent is not explicitly clear.
- **High Recall, Low Precision**: While traditional search returns many results, it may lack the precision needed for nuanced or complex queries.

### Semantic Search with Large Language Models
Semantic search, on the other hand, utilizes LLMs and embeddings to overcome the limitations of keyword-based search. By embedding both queries and documents in a high-dimensional vector space, semantic search allows for understanding and matching the meaning behind words rather than their literal text. This enables:
- **Contextual Matching**: Results are based on context and meaning rather than just keywords.
- **Synonym and Phrase Matching**: Recognizes similar meanings, even if different words or phrases are used.
- **Improved Precision and Relevance**: Delivers more accurate results, especially for complex or nuanced queries.

## Key Concepts in Semantic Search

### Keyword Search
Keyword search uses exact term matching and is often the starting point for simple search needs. While fast and efficient, it is limited to matching only literal occurrences of terms in the document corpus. Semantic search builds on this by using LLMs to analyze and match concepts rather than specific words.

### Embeddings
Embeddings are vector representations of text data, where words, phrases, or even entire documents are represented as dense vectors in high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture semantic relationships, enabling LLMs to identify similarities in meaning between different texts. In this project:
- **Text Embeddings** are used to encode both the query and documents, allowing for similarity-based matching.
- **Cosine Similarity** is commonly used to measure how close two embeddings are in vector space, with closer vectors indicating higher semantic similarity.

### Dense Retrieval
Dense retrieval refers to using LLM embeddings to perform initial retrieval in the semantic search pipeline. Instead of relying on sparse vectors (like traditional TF-IDF vectors), dense retrieval uses embedding models that produce dense vectors for documents and queries. The steps include:
1. **Embedding Creation**: Encode the query and all documents into embeddings.
2. **Vector Similarity Search**: Find documents with embeddings most similar to the query embedding, typically using cosine similarity or nearest neighbor search.

This enables highly relevant documents to be retrieved even if they lack exact keyword matches.

### Reranking
Once a set of documents is retrieved through dense retrieval, a reranking model is often used to order the results based on relevance. Reranking fine-tunes the search results by analyzing both the context of the query and the document content more deeply. For this project:
- **Reranking Models** help prioritize the most contextually relevant documents, enhancing the precision of the results.
- This step typically uses transformer-based models to evaluate document-query pairs, ensuring the top-ranked results are the most relevant.

### Generating Answers
In addition to retrieving documents, LLMs are capable of directly generating answers based on retrieved information. This final step transforms semantic search from merely finding relevant documents to providing concrete answers to user queries. For example:
- **LLMs are used to synthesize answers** by extracting key information from the highest-ranked documents, generating a coherent response that directly addresses the query.
- This makes the semantic search pipeline capable of functioning as a question-answering system, delivering concise and relevant information directly.

## Libraries Used

In this project, we used the following libraries:
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing various machine learning tasks, including vector similarity computations.
- **UMAP-learn**: For visualizing high-dimensional embeddings, helping to observe the clustering and spread of data points in the embedding space.
- **cohere**: get an api key
- **weaviate**
- **tqdm**: For tracking progress in long-running tasks.
- **torch**: For building and training the deep learning models, particularly transformer-based LLMs used for dense retrieval and reranking.

## Conclusion

By leveraging LLMs for semantic search, this project demonstrates a robust and effective search system that far surpasses traditional keyword-based search in relevance and accuracy. Through the combined use of embeddings, dense retrieval, reranking, and answer generation, the project provides a comprehensive search solution suitable for various industry applications, including customer support, knowledge retrieval, and intelligent information systems.
